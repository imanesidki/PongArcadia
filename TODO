sign up logic

1. Determine the request type (GET or POST)
   If the request is GET (user is visiting the signup page), you should display an empty signup form.
   If the request is POST (user has submitted the form), you should process the form data.
2. Form handling logic
   Use Django's UserCreationForm or your custom form to create a new user.
   On GET, you display the form.
   On POST, you validate the form.
   If valid, you save the user (create a new user).
   If invalid, you display errors and allow the user to correct the form.
3. Redirection or response
   After a successful signup, redirect the user to a different page (e.g., login or home page).
   If the form is invalid, re-render the form with error messages.
   Pseudocode for Signup Logic
   If request method is GET:
   Display an empty form.
   If request method is POST:
   Validate the form data.
   If valid:
   Create a new user.
   Redirect to the login page.
   If not valid:
   Re-render the form with error messages.

   This is the mental framework you can follow before writing your code:

4. Handle the request method
   GET: Display the signup form.
   POST: Process the form submission.
5. Form validation
   Check if the form data is valid.
   If it is, create a user.
   If not, return to the form page with error messages.
6. Successful submission
   After successful signup, redirect to the login page or a welcome page.
